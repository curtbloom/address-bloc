1. Since the data is sorted I would do a Binary search
   because it would cut the data that needs to be searched in half
   and find the result much faster.

2. Since this is unsorted and not a large list I would use an iterative
   search.

3. Another sorted list so I would use a Binary search.

4. If I have the resources to, I would sort the checkpoints
   then I would do a Binary search. If I do not have the resoureces
   to sort them I would be forced to do an iterative search.
